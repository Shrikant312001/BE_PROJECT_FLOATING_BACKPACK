# BE_PROJECT_FLOATING_BACKPACK
The study assesses a suspended-load backpack's effect on gait, aiming to minimize vertical load motion. It proposes a design allowing the load to move relative to the wearer during walking and running, reducing fluctuations. It addresses muscle fatigue, enhances endurance, and mitigates injury risks like stress fractures, knee, and back pain.
